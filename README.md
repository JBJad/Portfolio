# Portfolio

## Basic information
My name is Justyna, I have been testing for over a year now as a solo manual tester in the organization (some might call it QA Officer). At the moment my main goal is to learn on the job and understand software development life cycle with the QA strictly implemented right from the planning phase of the project.
